 * THIS CODE WILL THROW Compilation Errors
 * Code for demonstrating the use of keyword memory and storage
 * 
 * PLEASE IGNORE THE Warnings:
 *     "Unused local variable" As this is demo code we are not using the variables
 *     "Function state mutability ...." .... You will learn the use of view keyword :)
 * In real code you would address the warnings
 * 
 * Keyword "public" added to functions to suppress warnings - March 2018
